# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I wanted to build a webpage to store all the notes I made during the prework part of the course. This webpage will make studying easier by consolidating all the information I have learned so far in one place.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each section of the webpage contains notes about a certain topic. There's a HTML section, a CSS section, a JavaScript section and a Git section. And if you open the DevTools console, it will list the topics we've learned. It will also choose a topic for us to study first.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
